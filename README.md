# Getting started with UI for Android
The SDK examples of the UI for Android components are to be found in the Samples-Java folder. To run the project, import it in Android Studio, extract the UI for Android binaries into the `libs` folder and rename **all** them by stripping the version as follows:
- Common.aar
- Primitives.aar
- Input.aar
.....

Build and run the project.

# Getting started with UI for Xamarin.Android
The SDK examples of the Xamarin wrappers of UI for Android are to be found in the Samples-Xamarin folder. To run the project, install the latest version of Xamarin on your computer, extract the UI for Xamarin.Android DLLs into a `Binaries` folder right next to Samples-Xamarin folder. Build and run the project.
